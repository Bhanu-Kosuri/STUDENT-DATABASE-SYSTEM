STUDENT DATABASE SYSTEM PROJECT:
This project is a Student Database Management System developed in C++ using Linked Lists and File Handling. 
It allows users to manage student records efficiently.
The system supports operations like adding new students, searching, editing, deleting existing records, displaying all students, and saving data to a file. 
It uses structured data handling, input validation, and a menu-driven interface for ease of use.
The system ensures data persistence by storing all information in a file, making it both memory-efficient and reliable.

Compile the program: g++ *.cpp or g++ *.cpp -o SDB

Run the program: ./a.out or ./SDB
